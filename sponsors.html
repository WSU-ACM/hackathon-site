    </p>
    <h2 class="c0"><a name="h.1jlmbihwhghi"></a><span class="c1 c14">Why sponsorship is beneficial to you and the students:</span></h2>
    <p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1">It is a well known fact that hackathons create lively interest among student engineers. When a company decides to become a sponsor, that company&rsquo;s name will be associated with one of the most memorable 24 hours of all time for hundreds of prospective developers. But more than that, a sponsor will have the ability to inspire and even </span><span class="c1 c6">be </span><span class="c1">inspired by the next generation of innovators during one ocf the largest celebrations of creativity, innovation, and technology in the state. In addition, a sponsor will have the opportunity to meet one-on-one with the students as a mentor, judicator, advocate of education, and possibly, future co-worker.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c0"><a name="h.c0fd1ho7p76b"></a><span class="c1 c5">Deadlines, dates, and requirements:</span></h2><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1">The deadline for a yes/no confirmation and declaration of sponsorship level (as described in the section &ldquo;Sponsorship levels&rdquo; of this document) is </span><span class="c1 c9">January 1st.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If this deadline is missed, sponsorship is still encouraged, but we will not be able to guarantee your name across all mediums of advertising (particularly on posters).</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1">The date of the competition</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">is </span><span class="c1 c9">February 7th &amp; February 8th 2015</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c0 c16"><a name="h.lgetyx2igk51"></a><span class="c1 c5">What</span><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;does sponsorship mean?</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a sponsor, you can choose to </span><span class="c1">make donations in a few different ways. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1 c6"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1 c6">Meal donations:</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a sponsor, you may choose to help us by covering the expenses of a meal. Your company&rsquo;s name will be attached to the meal.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1 c6">Prize donations:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another option is to donate prizes and company swag for the winners of the competition. You get to choose what the prizes are.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1 c6">Monetary donations:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can also provide us with monetary donations and we will figure out the best way to utilize that income for the event.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c0"><a name="h.h98584eausnb"></a><span class="c1 c5">Sponsorship levels</span></h2>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition to choosing how</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;you donate, you may also choose a </span><span class="c1 c6">sponsorship level</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;This refers to the total value your company chooses to donate-- including the value of any prizes or meals.</span></p>

    <p class="c0 c7 c17"><span class="c1 c4">The supporter sponsorship level is intended for any individuals/groups who would like to donate a small amount of money for the competition. </span><span class="c4 c1">The club sponsorship level is only available to any registered Washington State University student organizations</span><span class="c4 c1">.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c0"><a name="h.i8s17c2ahw0b"></a><span class="c1 c5">Wh</span><span class="c1 c5">at are the benefits</span><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;of sponsoring?</span></h2>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1 c10">Naturally, the more we receive, the more we will give back. The table below shows how we will advertise your company based on your level of sponsorship. Note that silver, gold, and platinum will be advertised on every available medium. The difference between these top three levels is a significant difference in the amount of space we will allot for your company&rsquo;s name/logo. Platinum sponsors will naturally have the most space allotted.</span></p>
