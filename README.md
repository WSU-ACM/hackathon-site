Site for CrimsonCode Hackathon. Template from Start Bootstrap.

In order for any new changes in master to show up on the website, it needs to be published:
1. Obtain access to the LUG (Linux Users' Group) server for the hackathon site (talk to the current president or sysadmin)
2. In a terminal, set the environment variable for HACKATHON_USER to the username given to you by the LUG once you have access
   export HACKATHON_USER=[insert username here] (this only sets the variable for the current session)
3. Make sure you are in the hackathon directory and then run the "deploy_script.sh"

If you have any issues, contact whoever set up your access to the server and if they are unable to help, contact a past ACM chair or troubleshoot via Google.
