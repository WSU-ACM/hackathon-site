			<h3>FAQ</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>What is a Hackathon?</dt>
				<dd>
					A Hackathon is a day long event where we
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_(programmer_subculture)" target="_blank">
						"hack"
					</a> things. The term hack in this form is more in the sense
					that we are creating something very quickly and hastily. Not the
					sneaking-our-way-into-NSA-servers form of the term. If you
					would like to learn more about hackathons, go ahead and apply
					the
					<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hackathon" target="_blank">
						universal algorithm</a>.
				</dd>

				<dt>Free?!?!</dt>
				<dd>
					Yes, free! Thank the sponsors for all the delicious food and prizes!
				</dd>

				<dt>Do I have to be a WSU student?</dt>
				<dd>
					No, anyone can participate.
				</dd>

				<dt>How much experience is required to participate?</dt>
				<dd>
					None really. You have got 24 hours, so feel free to learn on the spot.
					You may not be very successful, but most of the fun of a hackathon
					is the spirit and community of seeing not only what you can do, but
					also what others have done.
				</dd>

				<dt>Do I have to have a team?</dt>
				<dd>
					No, you do not have to have a team, but it is recommended. Not often
					do we have the opportunity to plow through a project
					with a good friend for 24 hours straight.
				</dd>

				<dt id="hardware-software-faq">I can pick any hardware or software idea?</dt>
				<dd>
					Yes! Anything is possible. It just has to be from scratch.
					This is your chance to spend 24 hours
					tinkering and learning about something you would not normally have
					the time for. If you think you can get even a half-finished, 
					albeit partially broken, version of your idea done in 24 hours,
					go for it! Just know your audience is tech driven so you may not
					get much notoriety for a radical new recipe for "no bake" cookies.
				</dd>
				
				<dt id="from-scratch-faq">What do you mean, "from scratch"?</dt>
				<dd>
					Strictly speaking, that means no previous construction,
					virtual (writing code) or physical (sticking arduino boards together). 
					However, no one ever builds anything from scratch today, that is 
					just stupid. For that reason, use of software or hardware that were 
					not specifically created 
					for your idea are of
					course okay. With that said, we specifically ask that you
					refrain from working on
					anything related to school. These rules are not strictly enforced,
					but please abide by the
					hackathon spirit!
				</dd>

				<dt>Why should I do this, are there prizes?</dt>
				<dd>
					Yes! Prizes! Food! Fun! Don't take our word for it, come and see for
					yourself. It is free, so what is there to lose? This is one of the
					few opportunities where you can set time aside and work distraction
					free on that project you and your buddies have dreamed about
					working on. Plus, you can show off your amazing abilities directly to
					potential employers, and network with peers to
					get a feel for the world outside of college.
				</dd>

				<dt>Wait, engineers socialize?</dt>
				<dd>
					Suprisingly, yes! And if you are someone who wants to socialize
					with other engineers I recommend joining one of the clubs!
				</dd>

				<dt>
					Is it true that people who participate in the Hackathon are the
					coolest people in the world?
				</dt>
				<dd>Yes.</dd>

				<dt>Will there be food?</dt>
				<dd>Yes, this event will be fully catered. Free of charge.</dd>

				<dt>Do I have to stay the whole time?</dt>
				<dd>
					We aren't going to chain you down and force you to stay,
					but we are very much encouraging that everyone stay the whole time.
					It really adds to the atmosphere to have everyone there
					during the whole event.
