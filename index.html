			<h3>FAQ</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>What is a Hackathon?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						A Hackathon is <span itemprop="description">a day long team
						programming competition</span>
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Do you really hack computers?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						No, we use the term 'hacking' to refer to the programmer culture of hackers.
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_(programmer_subculture)">Link for reference</a>
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt id="hardware-software-faq">All hardware and software?</dt>
				<dd>
					Yes! Anything is possible. This is your chance to spend 24 hours 
					tinkering and learning about something you wouldn't normally have
					the time for. If you think you can get even a half-finished, 
					albeit partially broken, version of your idea done in 24hours, 
					go for it! Just know your audience is tech driven so you may not
					get much notoriety for a radical new recipe for "no bake" cookies.
				</dd>
				
				<dt id="from-scratch-faq">What do you mean, "from scratch"?</dt>
				<dd>
					Strictly speaking, that means no previous construction, 
					virtual (writing code) or physical (sticking arduino boards together). 
					However, no one ever builds anything from scratch today, that is 
					just stupid. For that reason, use of software or hardware that were 
					not specifically created 
					for your idea are of
					course okay. This isn't strictly enforced, but please abide by the
					hackathon spirit!
				</dd>

				<dt>Do I have to be a WSU student?</dt>
				<dd>
					No, anyone can participate.
				</dd>

				<dt>How much experience is required to participate?</dt>
				<dd>
					None really. You've got 24 hours, so feel free to learn on the spot.
					You may not be very successful, but most of the fun of a hackathon
					is the spirit and community of seeing not only what you can do, but
					also what others have done.
				</dd>

				<dt>Do I have to have a team?</dt>
				<dd>
					No, you do not have to have a team, but it is recommended. Not often
					do we have the opportunity to plow through a project 
					with a good friend.
				</dd>

				<dt>Why should I do this, are there prizes?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						First of all, yes, there are prizes, but the even bigger reason
						you should do this is because the skills you learn from
						participating are extremely valuable.
						Also, its a great resume piece, companies love to see that you
						do this type of thing.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Wait, engineers socialize?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Suprisingly, yes! and if you are someone who wants to socialize
						with other engineers I recommend joining one of the clubs!
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>
					Is it true that people who participate in the Hackathon are the
					coolest people in the world?
				</dt>
				<dd><p>Yes.</p></dd>

				<dt>Will there be food?</dt>
				<dd><p>Yes, this event will be fully catered.</p></dd>

				<dt>Do I have to stay the whole time?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						We aren't going to chain you down and force you to stay,
						but we are VERY MUCH encouraging that everyone stay the whole time.
						It really adds to the atmosphere to have everyone there during the whole event.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Well I'm sold, how do I sign up?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Sign ups will be handled on eventbrite.com. Registration will open soon!
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Where will it be?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p itemprop="location" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Place">
						The event will be held in the
						<span itemprop="name">Smith Center for Undergraduate Education</span>
						(CUE or SCUE).
