      <h2 class="text-wsucrimson">General Information</h2>
      <p>In order to make sure that you have all the time you need to prepare for the hackathon, we've prepared some information for you.</p>
      <h4><b>Will there be food?</b></h4>
      <p>
        So much food. All meals will be covered as well as snacks along the way.
      </p>
      <h4><b>How many people can be on one team?</b></h4>
      <p>
        The 2017 Crimson Code will be the first hackathon where we allow <b>4 hackers per team</b>.
        We have raised this to encourage students to bring in students from more diverse academic backgrounds.
        You still may have four total programmers; however the intent is to ensure that teams get more value.
      </p>
      <h4><b>Do I have to stay all night?</b></h4>
      <p>
        Some students choose to forgo sleep to work on their projects; however
        after the hacking starts you are free to work wherever you like. If you need
        to go home to sleep feel free! Just be back around 9:00 AM on Sunday for breakfast.
      </p>
      <h4><b>Can I work alone?</b></h4>
      <p>
        Yes! However at the start of the event we will be hosting a mixer for students who are looking for teammates.
      </p>
      <h4><b>What if I don't have any ideas?</b></h4>
      <p>
        We will have some staff on hand who can help point you in the right direction,
        the most important thing is to show up! This event is recommended for all students!
      </p>
      <h4><b>Can I work on my project beforehand?</b></h4>
      <p>
        We encourage everyone to start a brand new project. However, you're allowed to
        develop libraries or use outside libraries to help you with your project. If
        you think you might be in sketchy territory, find an organizer at the beginning to have us look.
