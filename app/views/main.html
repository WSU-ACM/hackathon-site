      <p>In order to make sure that you have all the time you need to prepare for the hackathon, we've prepared some informtaion for you.</p>
      <h4><b>Will there be food?</b></h4>
      <p>
        So much food. All meals will be covered as well as snacks along the way.
      </p>
      <h4><b>How many people can be on one team?</b></h4>
      <p>
        The 2017 Crimson Code will be the first hackathon where we allow <b>4 hackers per team</b>.
        We have raised this to encourage students to bring in students from more diverse academic backgrounds.
        You still may have four total programmers; however the intent is to ensure that teams get more value.
