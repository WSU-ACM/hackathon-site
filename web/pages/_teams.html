<p>Note: If you have a team and are looking for teammates, here are a few things 
you can do so you are ready:</p>
<br />

<h3>Join Your Team || Switch Teams</h3>
Yes, we know you made a team, however, due to how Eventbrite works, you might not be a part of your team.
<ol class="numbered">
  <li>Log in to Eventbrite, and go to <strong>My Tickets</strong></li>
  <li>Under Current Orders, click <strong>View Order</strong> for EECS WSU Hackathon</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Transfer</strong></li>
  <li>Choose <strong>Team</strong></li>
  <li>Search for your team (or make one if you don't have one yet)</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Continue</strong> and after verifying the information is correct, click 
      <strong>Continue</strong> again 
      <br />//Don't worry, the ticket will still belong to you, you are just a member of your 
      team now</li>
</ol>

<br/>

<h3>Make Your Team Visibile</h3>
This only needs to be done by the team captain.
<ol class="numbered">
