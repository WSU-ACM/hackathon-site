<h1>Hackathon Sponsorship Information</h1>
<br />

<h2>Why sponsorship is beneficial to you and the students:</h2>
<p>
  It is a well known fact that hackathons create lively interest among
  student engineers. When a company decides to become a sponsor,
  that company's name will be associated with one of the most memorable
  24 hours of all time for hundreds of prospective developers.
  But more than that, a sponsor will have the ability to inspire and even
  <em>be</em> inspired by the next generation of innovators during one of the
  largest celebrations of creativity, innovation, and technology in the
  state. In addition, a sponsor will have the opportunity to meet
  one-on-one with the students as a mentor, judicator,
  advocate of education, and possibly, future co-worker.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Deadlines, dates, and requirements:</h2>
<p>
  The deadline for a yes/no confirmation and declaration of sponsorship
  level (as described in the section "Sponsorship levels" of this document)
  is <strong>January 1st</strong>. If this deadline is missed, sponsorship is still
  encouraged, but we will not be able to guarantee your name across all
  mediums of advertising (particularly on posters).
</p>
<p>
  The date of the competition is
  <strong>February 7th &amp; February 8th 2015</strong>.

<h2>What does sponsorship mean?</h2>
<p>As a sponsor, you can choose to make donations in a few different ways.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Meal donations:</h3>
    <p>
      As a sponsor, you may choose to help us by covering the expenses
      of a meal. Your company's name will be attached to the meal.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Prize donations:</h3>
    <p>
      Another option is to donate prizes and company swag for the winners
      of the competition. You get to choose what the prizes are.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Monetary donations:</h3>
    <p>
      You can also provide us with monetary donations and we will figure
      out the best way to utilize that income for the event.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<br />

<h2>Sponsorship levels</h2>
<p>
  In addition to choosing how you donate, you may also choose a
  <em>sponsorship level</em>. This refers to the total value your company
  chooses to donate -- including the value of any prizes or meals.

    The supporter sponsorship level is intended for any individuals/groups
    who would like to donate a small amount of money for the competition.
    The club sponsorship level is only available to any registered
    Washington State University student organizations.

<h2>What are the benefits of sponsoring?</h2>
<p>
  Naturally, the more we receive, the more we will give back.
  The table below shows how we will advertise your company based on
  your level of sponsorship. Note that silver, gold, and platinum
  will be advertised on every available medium. The difference
  between these top three levels is a significant difference in the
  amount of space we will allot for your company's name/logo.
  Platinum sponsors will naturally have the most space allotted.

<h2>What about sending some representatives?</h2>
<p>
  We encourage sponsors at any level to send representatives out to the
  Washington State University campus for the event. While sending
  representatives does not affect the level of sponsorship granted
  to your company, it is considered its own benefit to do so.
  Company representatives will be invited to join the panel of judges
  at the end of the competition to determine the winners.
  It is also worth mentioning that sponsors at our event will have the
  opportunity to meet (and possibly even mentor) some of the brightest
  students WSU has to offer. Sponsors who are present at our event
  will be invited to a complementary lunch with EECS faculty.
  Our Washington State University president, Elson Floyd,
  may even join the lunch as well!
