  <h1>FAQ</h1>
  <dl>
    <dt>What is a Hackathon?</dt>
    <dd>
      A Hackathon is a day long event where we
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_(programmer_subculture)" target="_blank">
        "hack"
      </a> things. The term hack in this context is more in the sense
      that we are creating something very quickly and hastily. We are not hacking in the sense
      of gaining unauthorized access to anything. The purpose is to create a
      fun environment for people to collaborate and learn from each other while
      creating something we would not normally have time for.
      If you would like to learn more about hackathons, go ahead and apply
      the
      <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hackathon" target="_blank">
        universal algorithm</a>.
    </dd>

    <dt>I'm still confused. What do you mean by the term hacking?</dt>
    <dd>
      Let us help you. In the world of computer culture, a "hack" is a quick
      and potentially shoddy piece of work to get something working. Have
      you heard the term "life-hack"? Then you already have a pretty good
      idea what it means to hack.
      "Hacking" is the act of doing a series of these quick and potentially shoddy
      pieces of work. This is what a hackathon is about. While a "hacker"
      will more often than not self-identify as someone who breaks into
      computer systems, "hacking" in the general sense only means
      to break into a computer when it
      is explicitly made apparent in the phrase "hack into" or "hacking into".
      Remember, while hacking into computers can seem fun, it can be illegal
      or involve grey areas of the law that can land you with massive fines,
      jail,	and/or legal fees. Unless you have been given permission,
      don't do it! Now hopefully you understand that's not what a hackathon is
      about. We don't break into things. We build things!
    </dd>

    <dt>Free?!?!</dt>
    <dd>
      Yes, free! Thank the sponsors for all the delicious food and prizes!
    </dd>

    <dt>Do I have to be a WSU student?</dt>
    <dd>
      No, anyone can participate.
    </dd>

    <dt>Do you provide travel reimbursement?</dt>
    <dd>
      Sorry, at this time we can not. Your best bet is to pool
      together with
      friends and see if you have any clubs/organizations that can fund you.
      Please keep in touch with us though so we know of your situation and
      can help you make plans. At the very least, we can find you a place to
      stay in Pullman.
    </dd>

    <dt>How much experience is required to participate?</dt>
    <dd>
      None really. You have got 24 hours, so feel free to learn on the spot.
      You may not be very successful, but most of the fun of a hackathon
      is the spirit and community of seeing not only what you can do, but
      also what others have done.
    </dd>

    <dt id="team-faq">Do I have to have a team?</dt>
    <dd>
      No, you do not have to have a team, but it is recommended. Not often
      do we have the opportunity to plow through a project
      with a good friend for 24 hours straight. Check 
      <strong><a href="teams.html">here</a></strong> for more 
      information about finding a team.
    </dd>

    <dt>Where can I find people to join into a team with?</dt>
    <dd>
      No worries. If you want a teammate, we will do our best to connect you
      with people that are also looking for teammates. Be on the lookout for
      hackathon sponsored activities where we will be able to best help you.
      Check <strong><a href="teams.html">here</a></strong> for more 
      information about finding a team.
    </dd>

    <dt id="hardware-software-faq">I can pick any hardware or software idea?</dt>
    <dd>
      Yes! Anything is possible. It just has to be from scratch.
      This is your chance to spend 24 hours
      tinkering and learning about something you would not normally have
      the time for. If you think you can get even a half-finished,
      albeit partially broken, version of your idea done in 24 hours,
      go for it! Just know your audience is tech driven so you may not
      get much notoriety for a radical new recipe for "no bake" cookies.
    </dd>

    <dt id="from-scratch-faq">What do you mean, "from scratch"?</dt>
    <dd>
      Strictly speaking, that means no previous construction,
      virtual (writing code) or physical (sticking arduino boards together).
      However, no one ever builds anything from scratch today, that is
      just stupid. For that reason, use of software or hardware that were
      not specifically created for your idea are of
      course okay. With that said, we specifically ask that you
      refrain from working on anything related to school. These rules are 
      not strictly enforced, but please abide by the hackathon spirit!
    </dd>

    <dt>Why should I do this, are there prizes?</dt>
    <dd>
      Yes! Prizes! Food! Fun! Don't take our word for it, come and see for
      yourself. It is free, so what is there to lose? This is one of the
      few opportunities where you can set time aside and work distraction
      free on that project you and your buddies have dreamed about
      working on. Plus, you can show off your amazing abilities directly to
      potential employers, and network with peers to
      get a feel for the world outside of college.
    </dd>

    <dt>What if I don't have a kick ass idea?</dt>
    <dd>
      No worries. We will keep you posted on workshops and talks to help
      you come up with kick ass ideas. Also, it is highly recommended to
      be a part of an EECS club as they will be an excellent source
      of inspiration. If that doesn't help, we made a <strong>
      <a href="ideas.html">kick ass page</a></strong> that might!
    </dd>

    <dt>Wait, engineers socialize?</dt>
    <dd>
      Suprisingly, yes! And if you are someone who wants to socialize
      with other engineers we recommend joining one of the clubs!
    </dd>

    <dt>
      Is it true that people who participate in the Hackathon are the
      coolest people in the world?
    </dt>
    <dd>Yes.</dd>

    <dt>Will there be food?</dt>
    <dd>Yes, this event will be fully catered. Free of charge.</dd>

    <dt>Do I have to stay the whole time?</dt>
    <dd>
      We aren't going to chain you down and force you to stay,
      but we are very much encouraging that everyone stay the whole time.
      It really adds to the atmosphere to have everyone there
      during the whole event.
