<h2>Why would sponsoring CrimsonCode be beneficial?</h2>
<p>
  In years past, it has been established in the WSU community that our annual hackathons
  inspire an unmatched passion for innovation among the student engineers here at WSU. If
  you decide to become a sponsor for CrimsonCode:
</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
  <li>
    You will be associated with one of the largest technologically inventive events in
    Eastern Washington.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will have the ability to inspire, and be
    inspired by, the next generation of innovators during this incredible collective
    expression of scientific creativity.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will have the opportunity to meet one-on-one with the students here at
    WSU as a mentor, judicator, advocate of education, and
    possibly, future employer.
  </li>
  <li>
    These are the engineering professionals of the future and we want them to meet you!
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What does a CrimsonCode sponsorship mean?</h2>
<p>
  As a sponsor, you can choose to make donations in a few different ways:
</p>
<ol class="numbered">
  <li>
    In-kind donations
  </li>
  <li>
    A professor/graduate student or two to serve as judges and/or mentors on the day of
    the event
  </li>
  <li>
    Monetary donations
  </li>
  <li>
    Swag! E.g. stickers, flash drives, etc.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>What are the benefits of sponsoring?</h2>
<p>
  Naturally, the more we receive, the more we will give back. The table below shows how we
  will advertise you based on your level of sponsorship. The difference between these top
  three levels is the variance in the amount of space we will allot for your name/logo.
  The title sponsor will naturally have the most space allotted and will be recognized as a partner,
  e.g. ACM WSU Chapter and YOU presents: CrimsonCode.

<h2>What are the deadlines, dates, and requirements?</h2>
<p>
  The deadline for a yes/no confirmation and declaration of sponsorship level is March 7th.
  If this deadline is missed,
  sponsorship is still encouraged, but we will not be able to guarantee your name across all
  mediums of advertising (particularly on posters).

<hr />
<p>
  Hackathons are a great way to watch students code and develop a complete project in a
  limited amount of time. You can learn so much more about prospective graduate students
  than you would in a classroom setting. In addition, students can interact with you
  and get a feel for your culture, as well as learn about
  what you look for in potential employees. What better way is there to gain exposure
  to students and get them interested in what you do?
